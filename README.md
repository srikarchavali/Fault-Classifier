# Fault-Classifier

●	Built a supervised machine learning model with 95% accuracy for detecting and classifying defects in an automobile transmission system. 
●	Applied feature selection (MRMR, NCA) and identified 5 key features out of 18 and used dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, LDA) to optimize data. 
●	Trained KNN, Bayesian, Decision Tree classifiers, generated confusion charts and compared their performance metrics to select the model best suited for the task.
